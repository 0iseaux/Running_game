**[Play Now](./spel.html)**

## How to Play

### 1) Set players' names

When prompted, enter Player 1 and Player 2's names respectively.
The defaults are _Player 1_ and _Player 2_.

### 2) Select animal icons

Use the cursor to select an animal icon other than the default.
The choice can be changed anytime throughout the game.

### 3) Start the race

Player 1 and Player 2 should alternate between keys **A** & **D** and **J** & **L** respectively to get her/ his animal icon to move forward. The faster the key pair is pressed, the further the animal icon moves, and scores and speeds are calculated accordingly.

#### 4) Pause / resume the race

Use a cursor to press the **Pause/ Resume** button to pause or resume the race.

#### 4) Winning

The player whose animal icon reaches the far right first wins.

##### 5) Cheating

It is possible to (try to) cheat but **there are consequences**!

## Development Notes

This game was developed as an experiment in the very early stage of my coding journey to explore gamemaking, as well as emojis instead of icons.
As a result, it relies exclusively on basic HTML, CSS (e.g. keyframes and transitions) and JavaScript (e.g. DOM manipulation, ES6 classes).
While it has clear limitations in terms of UX and development, and can certainly improve with the use of React.js and Canvas, it was a fun exercise to explore the possibilities with the most basics.
